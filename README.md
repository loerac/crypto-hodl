# crypto-hodl
I have cryptocurrency in different exchanges and it can be a hassle on keeping track which coin is where, and what my P/L actually is. I started to store the information on a spreadsheet but it looked tacky and not phone friendly to add in new orders on the fly. So now, I just read and writemy orders to [Google Spreadsheet](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api) through their API.

Using Streamlit, I display my cryptocurrency HODL (Holding On for Dear Life) with an area to add new orders. Also have an area to see news about the cryptocurrencys.

Using [IEX Cloud](https://iexcloud.io/) API to get the price and news, and [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) API to get general information.
